# Ninjas-Tale-Prototype
A 2d "casual stealth" game I made for my 1st major project on my Games Development Level 3 course. The "casual" part meant that the game was supposed to put you in situations where you needed to improvise. It was also supposed to almost be possible to avoid being stealthy altogether. Unfortunately, I only had about 6 weeks to make the game and so wasn't quite able to achieve the "casual stealth" criteria I had chosen. 

# Installation
If you don't mind slightly worse performance, you can play the prototype in your browser: https://hedgehog125.github.io/Ninjas-Tale-Prototype/

Otherwise download a build from the releases or build it using Unity 2020.3.4f1.
